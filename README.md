## Programming and Refactoring Process 
### Pair Programming 
Basically we were performing **Driver-Navigator** style of pair programming in the project. After clarifying the user stories that should be implemented in a iteration and the interface of the class and methods, the **Driver** focused on the details of the implementation, and the **Navigator** reviewed the codes, observed whether there existed any bug or obstacle. During the project, the role switched frequently among two of us, thus both of us have chance to experience how a project is built. Below is how the workflow goes: 
* Define user stories that should be implemented and divide the tasks 
* Make an agreement on the object model and specify the interface 
* The **Driver** starts coding and the **Navigator** keeps observing the screen of **Driver**
* If **Navigator** finds a potential bug or issue, the **Navigator** writes a test to verify and the **Driver** refactors the codes until passes the test
### Refactoring 
After Alpha release completed, we inspected the codes and match them against following checklist: 
* if there is replicated code, then we investigate whether it is possible to encapsulate it into a method to improve reusability. 
* if there is redundant class, then we collapse it can dispatch its responsibility to the class that is interested in it.  
* if there is any attribute or method that are not supposed to be visible to class user, we set the visibility to private. 
* check if there if any hierarchical relationship can be built between objects 
* check if the name of class, attribute or method can be made more understandable 

## Unit Test with TDD
To develop in eXtreme, under the Test-Driver developing, we use the Unit Test Tool to help us test the code the push our developing.

However, our goal is developing a RESTful server with the MVC architecture, the JUnit test tool is not convernient. Finally we use the Http request tools(list http script or Postman) to instead the JUnit to driven our developing.

## Daily Meeting 
### 10.4 meeting 
Went through the material again, and generated the user stories. 
### 10.15 meeting 
First iteration, Alpha release started, discussed how to implement and test Login feature. 
### 10.20 meeting 
Third iteration, Alpha release started, discussed how to implement application management feature. 
## Comparison between eXtreme and Object-Oriented Programming 
The extreme programming is much more efficient than object oriented programming. In object oriented programming approach, there is not much room for tolerating requirement and system change, thus it is required to go through the material over and over again to ensure there is no requirement or object model missing. Moreover, it is difficult to debug due to the fact that implementation always happens before test in object oriented approach. On the contrary, extreme programming allows for early testing thus it is easier and more smooth to debug and refactor. However, extreme programming does have drawbacks. The system architecture is not intuitive during the initial iteration, and after several iterations and when we wanted to identify the system hierarchy and decompose the system, we found the objects are highly coupled and it was hard to do the decomposition.
